# Repository Guidelines
## Prime Directive

- DO NOT stop until the tasks are completed.
- DO NOT introduce anti-patterns or quick hacks at all costs. Avoid technical debt.
- When coding, do test-driven development by spawning a subagent to write the tests, so that the test is blinded to the code prior to the run.
- Put temp files in the `temp` directory. Do not delete `temp` directory.
- If presented with irreversible options, ask first, don't anticipate my needs.
- I use `pnpm` (not `npm`) for JavaScript package management.
- I use `uv` for Python environment management.
- prefer each script file to have less 1000 lines. If longer than that, plan modularization.

Deliver results that are:

1. **Correct** (matches the request and repo conventions)
2. **Safe** (no destructive actions without explicit authorization)
3. **Verifiable** (commands run, evidence shown, uncertainty stated)
4. **Minimal** (small diffs, little churn, no needless dependencies)

## Project Structure & Module Organization
This repository folder is currently a minimal scaffold with no application code checked in yet. Keep all project files inside `webapp-feasibility-study/`; do not add or modify files in the parent repository unless explicitly requested.

When implementation starts, use a predictable layout:
- `src/` for application code
- `tests/` for automated tests
- `public/` or `assets/` for static files
- `docs/` for design notes or feasibility findings

Favor small, focused modules and keep related tests near the feature they validate or under `tests/` with matching names.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
This project uses an Express backend with Node.js scripts.

- `pnpm dev` starts the local Express server at `http://localhost:4173`.
- `pnpm test` runs the cohort feasibility engine and HTTP contract tests.

Scope Git commands to this folder because the Git root is the parent directory:
- `git status -- webapp-feasibility-study`
- `git diff -- webapp-feasibility-study`
- `git add webapp-feasibility-study/`

Preserve explicit scripts such as `pnpm dev`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm lint` when tooling is expanded.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Use 2 spaces for indentation in Markdown, JSON, YAML, and frontend code unless the selected stack has a stronger convention. Name files by purpose:
- `kebab-case` for filenames: `market-sizing-notes.md`
- `PascalCase` for React components: `StudyDashboard.tsx`
- `camelCase` for functions and variables

Adopt a formatter and linter with the first real code contribution and commit their config with the code that depends on it.

## Testing Guidelines
The current tests use Node's built-in test runner. Require tests for core logic and any calculations, parsers, or scoring rules used in the feasibility study.

Prefer names that mirror behavior, such as `tests/cost-model.test.ts` or `src/__tests__/cost-model.test.ts`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
The visible history only contains `first commit`, so there is no reliable existing convention to preserve. Use short, imperative commit subjects instead:
- `Add initial feasibility study structure`
- `Create cost model test scaffold`

Pull requests should stay narrowly scoped, summarize the change, list validation performed, and include screenshots when UI work is introduced.

## Agent-Specific Notes
Because this folder lives inside a larger Git repository, contributors and agents should avoid repo-wide commands unless they intentionally target the parent project. Keep searches, diffs, and staging limited to `webapp-feasibility-study/`.
